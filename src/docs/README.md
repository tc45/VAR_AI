## Getting Started

If you're new to the project, we recommend starting with the main README in the project root directory, then exploring the specific documentation files based on what you're looking to accomplish:

1. For working with network device configurations, see the parsers documentation
2. For understanding how to run and write tests, see the testing documentation

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding or updating features, please also update the relevant documentation. Documentation should be:

- Clear and concise
- Well-structured with proper Markdown formatting
- Include practical examples where possible
- Updated whenever corresponding code changes

## Convention

The documentation follows these conventions:

- Use Markdown (.md) for all documentation files
- Keep filenames short and descriptive
- Use heading levels appropriately (# for title, ## for major sections, etc.)
- Include code examples in code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Use relative links to reference other documentation files
